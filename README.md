# **NYPD Shooting Data Project**

---
### **About the Project**
This analysis aims to compare the rates of fatal and non-fatal gun violence events between different racial groups in New York City: Asian / Pacific Islander, Black, Black Hispanic, White, and White Hispanic. Data suggests that shooting incidents are more likely to take place between individuals of the same race, even if the majority of perpetrators are reported to be Black.

Analysis conducted using R.

### **About the Dataset**
The NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) dataset was taken from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic) on 10/30/2024. At the time of writing, this non-federal dataset lists every shooting incident that occurred in New York City from 2006 through 2023. Records in the dataset include information about each shooting incident including time, location, and demographics (age, race, and sex) of victims and perpetrators.
